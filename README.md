# Modelica Buildings Requirements library

This is the development site for testing adding features from the _Modelica_Requirements_ library
to the Modelica _Buildings_ library and its user guide.

Eventually, the code may be moved to `Buildings.Requirements`.

As this is ongoing experimental development, the code is not supported and it is not yet clear whether
it will be continued to be developed.

See https://github.com/lbl-srg/modelica-buildings-requirements/blob/main/Buildings_Requirements/package.mo for dependencies.

## License

As this is part of the development of the Modelica _Buildings_ Library, the library is available under the
same 3-clause BSD-license as the Modelica _Buildings_ Library.
